I developed a price comparison project using Python to track and compare product prices across multiple e-commerce websites. 
The script used web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup and requests to extract product details, prices, and availability based on user-defined keywords. 
I structured the data into a clean format and visualized price differences using charts or tables, helping users identify the best deals.
The project also included logic to handle dynamic content and avoid duplicate entries.
